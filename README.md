## No Assets
Because I have no idea about licensing I removed all the assets file. Still I left the respective code in place.

To get this to build and run accordingly you would need to add an assets/ folder to the root directory, inside that an models/ folder and add the files
* wizard.gltf
* hat.gltf
* old.gltf
* young.gltf

(wherever you are getting them from or what kind of models they are)

The files get loaded in the loading.rs, you can also change the paths there if you want to.

The ground texture should be named "dry_ground.png" and should be located in the assets/ folder.
